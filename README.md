# nps-builder

NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, a metric used in customer experience programmes. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are usually measured with a single question survey and reported with a number from -100 to +100. A higher score is desirable.

## Project description

You will be creating an (NPS) Survey Builder - a single web page split up into two halves (two-column layout): the left side contains **setting fields** for a **survey** which is rendered on the right side. 

The survey just has to be rendered, there does not need to be any interactivity (yet) - you cannot click on the stars/ratings etc.

A user chooses the settings on the left and clicks a button. The desired survey appears on the right. User can modify the settings and click the button again, a new survey will appear (without a page refresh).
